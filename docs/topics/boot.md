# Boot

## State

- Pi firmware → U-Boot → Redox bootloader (UEFI) → kernel, from the SD card
  or over the network (TFTP and HTTP from the build host, see
  [netboot.md](../netboot.md)).
- Network boot without an SD card, or with a card that has no
  `bootcode.bin`, tested on a Pi 3B+ on 2026-10-28.

## In progress

- [#18](https://github.com/redox-rpi/redox-rpi/issues/18) leave `pcid` and `audiod` out of the Pi images: experiment
  `pi-clean-boot`, passes in QEMU, Pi test #14.

- [#15](https://github.com/redox-rpi/redox-rpi/issues/15) boot the kernel straight from the Pi firmware, without
  U-Boot and the Redox bootloader (milestone v0.4.0), branch
  `fw-direct-boot`: `tools/rpi-boot-stub` as `kernel8.img` wraps the
  unchanged kernel; boots to the login prompt in QEMU `raspi3b`
  (`scripts/fw-direct-boot.sh --test`). Next: MAC address and command line
  from the firmware, then a Pi test with the serial console.

## Next

- `make-sdcard.sh` mode with `kernel8.img` and the initramfs on the FAT
  partition (#15).
